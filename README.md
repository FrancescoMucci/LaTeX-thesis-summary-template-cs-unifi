# LaTeX Template for Computer Science thesis summary at UniFI

This repository hosts a LaTeX template designed for the summary of either Bachelor's or Master's theses in Computer Science at the [University of Florence (UniFI)](https://www.unifi.it/).

I developed this template for my own Master's thesis summary starting from the [thesis template provided by my degree course](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/vp-17-per-laurearsi.html) which in turn was crafted using the [`classicthesis`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis) package, created by [Andr√© Miede](https://www.miede.de/), as a basis.

## How to generate the PDF of this thesis template?
